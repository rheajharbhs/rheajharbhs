- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rhea Jha (@rheajharbhs)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming html, css and javascript
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently writing simple gpa calculator for my school - Rock Bridge High School, Columbia, Missouri
- This application calculates both weighted and unweighted
- I have developed a simple working application.
- I would like to learn how to scale this to add more semesters without duplicating my html
